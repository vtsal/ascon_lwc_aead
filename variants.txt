v1: ASCON_AEAD+Hash

    Reference software:    
        crypto_aead: ascon128v12
        crypto_hash: asconhashv12
        
    Architecture description:
        Implementation of ASCON, with b=320, r=64, c=256, n=128, t=128, and h=256. Basic iterative architecture where 1 round of the ASCON permutation is executed in 1 clock cycle.

    Key setup time:
        0
        
    Execution time of authenticated encryption:
        24 + (Na*9) + (Nm*10) + 18
    Execution time of authenticated decryption:
        17 + (Na*9) + (Nc*10) + 20
    Execution time of hash:
        13 + (Nm*15) + (Nh*15)
